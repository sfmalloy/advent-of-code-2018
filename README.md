# Advent of Code 2018!!!

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2018.
If you want to download for yourself, compile using make and the run.

**Running**
----------------------------------
For single day:
    
    $ ./Advent -s <day_number>
    
For all days:
    
    $ ./Advent -a


**Timings**
----------------------------------
I obtained times from my desktop running Antergos and g++ 8.2.1.  Times are gotten as an average of 5 and by running parts 1 and 2 in the same run (not seperately).

Day # | Time (in ms) | # of Lines
