# Advent of Code 2018!!!

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2018.
If you want to download and run for yourself then compile using:
    $ g++ -Wall Advent.cc -o Advent
(makefile coming soon...)

**Running**
----------------------------------
For single day:
    
    $ ./Advent -s <day_number>
    
For all days:
    
    $ ./Advent -a

Times:
I obtained times from my desktop running Antergos and gcc 8.2.1.  Times are gotten as an average of 5.

**Timings**
